# DepreciateIO

My first Python Django project created for my Python class @ BCIT. 

The idea of this application is to help users find the optimal time to sell their phone should they choose to upgrade.

Users are able to create an account, where they are prompted to select their current device.

After selecting their device, users are shown a graph representing the estimated price of their device every year. This would allow them to
find the optimal time to sell their phone while giving them an idea of the price they would be able to sell it for. 

The data for the graph is created in the Django admin panel and displayed using CanvasJS.
